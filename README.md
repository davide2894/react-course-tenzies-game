# WHAT IS THIS 
A small project, my gaol is to reinforce and practice React state management and data passing fundamentals.

# WHAT I PRACTICED
- React components
- how to manage props
- how to pass state through components
- how NOT to pass state through components

# TODO
[x] fix style on all devices
[x] scss: use @use instead of @import (fix rources build errors)
[] fix js
    [x] fix die selection logic: all dices should be selected, not only the first of the dice list and the ones with the same number of the first of the dice list
    [x] can't click same selected die after page reload -> check console logs on click
        [x] keep state of dice array on page refresh
        [x] keep state of held dice (tenziesNumber) stat eon page refresh
[x] test
[] deploy app by using gh-pages
